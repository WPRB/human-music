# Muse.ic: A Playlist Manager for Listener Engagement

## Project Structure
We will organize the project into a few distinct Django "apps."  Each app is a collection of python modules, including a models.py database schema, that serve a single clearly defined purpose.  Currently there are two: _music_, which defines relationships between artists, songs, genres, record labels, etc.; and _playlist_ which defines DJs, plays, shows, etc.
